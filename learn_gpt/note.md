# Best Practices for Using AI Code Tools

1. Assume the answer is wrong
- it will appear correct
- it will be very confident in
its answer and try to convince
you the answer is correct
2. Assume the answer is stolen from
somewhere. (be concerned about
copyrights)
3. Tell the AI what guidelines and
Best Practices you want it to follow
- ex: "from this point forward
always use python
"f-strings"
- ex:"prefer libfmt over iostreams"
4. Assume the answer is wrong
5. Remember: They represent the
average code quality of the
internet.

## How To Use
* A smart "Rubber Duck"
* For inspiration for problem solving
* A "second set of eyes"
* Ex: pasting a C++ compiler
error in and asking it "what
went wrong?"
* A "quick start for new technology": If you totally don't know some new techs, then ask gpt to give you some examples
